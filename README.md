# Forkify - Search through over a million recipes

## Description
An application, which allows you to search through the [food2fork](https://www.food2fork.com/) API an retrieve recipes from all over the web. You can calculate servings, view directions on the author's website and add ingredients to a shopping list in order to make cooking your favorite foods easier and more manageable.

## Development Notes
The app makes use of vanilla JavaScript, the WEB API, the [food2fork API](https://www.food2fork.com/about/api). After adding your recipes to the liked list, you won't have to worry about closing your browser and losing all of them. The app makes use of the WEB API's `localStorage` object to store the data. Upon launching, you will see your recipes where you left them.
